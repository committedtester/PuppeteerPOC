As you are hopefully using vscode remember to apply
CTRL+Shift+B
And select
tsc:watch
This will automtically recompile your code whenever you save it


Other VSCode notes
- Extension
-- Prettier
-- Eslint (Enable settings of eslint.autoFixOnSave && prettier.useTabs)


Also avoiding the concept of using 'extend' to inherit from other pages. 
This breaks TypeScript. See: https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/31465
